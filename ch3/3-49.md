Acquiring deadlocks in a predictable order only works if you have a deterministic order and a deterministic set of resources to acquire

If a process acquires the first lock, and then gets the information it needs to acquire subsequent locks, it's possible to arrive at a deadlock situation.

Perhaps you need to update some resource based on it's relation with some entry in a set of related objects the top level resource has. To ensure correctness the process acquires the lock for the first resource, then looks up some information and tries to acquire a second lock on another resource based on the information it found. IF at the same time this process was also started with that second resource, a lock would already be acquired and the second process might attempt to acquire the lock on the first resource, resulting in a deadlock
