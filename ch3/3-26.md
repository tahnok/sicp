# Binary Tree based tables

So far, our tables have used unordered lists to store a sequence of (key, values) which means that access is O(size of table) (for a single level table)

Instead, we could use a binary tree for the keys, which would make lookup O(log size of table)
BUT this would mean that for every "insert" we might have to rebalance the tree which is expensive...

The structure would be that each "node" of the tree is a list containing (in order) a

- key
- value
- pointer to left tree | nil
- pointer to right tree | nil

Accessing a non-existent key would mean you have to traverse the height of the tree
