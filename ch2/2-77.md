This works because the code Alyssa provides exposes the selectors that used to
be internal to the install package.

(define z '(complex (rectangular (3 4))))

(magnitude z)

magnitude results in a call to apply-generic which looks up where to call
complex which calls apply-generic, which results in another call to apply-generic
