# a)

Ben is right because the body of the lambda contains only primitive procedures, which are not thunked

# b)

p1 returns (1 2), whereas p2 returns 1

This is because for p2, the set is in an argument, which is never forced. It's turned into a thunk,
and then not needed anywhere.

# c)

actual-value would work just as well as eval in the `for-each` example

# d)

I think Cy's approach is the most consistent with a language that includes side effects like
`set!`. If a programmer wasn't sure if an argument was ever called because it might be used
in a compound procedure somewhere it would become hard to reason about.
