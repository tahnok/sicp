A program that generated many procedures that were only ever evaluted once would
perform better without memoization since there would be no overhead involved in
storing the procedure. eg:

```
	(def (waste x)
		((lambda () (+ x 1))))
	(def (loop x)
		(if (= x 100)
			'done
			(loop (waste x))))
```

Conversly, a procedure like `fib` where calls like `(fib x)` would happen
often and would avoid an expensive computation

square would return 100 in each case, but the memoized interpreter would have
a count of 1, while the unmemoized would have a count of 2
