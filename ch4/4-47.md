without the recursive call, reording the list arg eval order leads to infinite recursion

this also does not work because amb is not lazy? so the seond branch consumes tokens when it should not (nope, this is wrong)

this does recurse forever, but this is because the list contains `(parse-verb-phrase)` which just failed to work and thus is recursing
