I would argue that Eva's view is the most "correct", but agree that supporting it would be a pain, and as such Alyssa is probably practically right.


The setting of each variable could be done as a queue. During the evaluation of the body of a 'define you would raise an error if it encounterd unassigned, but instead of crashing, the evaluation would be placed at the end of the queue. (Basically delay the evaluation of b until a is done). You would also need to detect cycles and crash in that case (ie: a depends on b which depends on a).
