The exercise procedure will not work since when we evaluate the inner let (which is turned into a lambda),
the variables will refer to y and dy, but these will set to '*unassigned' still.

So what will happen is that dy will evaluate y to '*unassigned' and not get updated. (or possibly it
will error since it tries to evaluate y to something '*unassigned'
