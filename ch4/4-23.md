In the simple case where a sequence only has one element in it,
the more complex version will be more efficient as it directly returns
the procedure to be exectured. Alyssa's version will have an extra layer
where it has to call execute sequence, check if there are more than 
one procedure in the list, then execute it.

The more complex version also builds up a lambda at analyze time that
is ready to be executed directly. Alyssa's version needs to check
for more expressions at run time.
