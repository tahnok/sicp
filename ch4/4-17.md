There is an extra frame because the define is a frame, then the let introduces another frame.

This should not impact the functioning of any program since the contents of intersection of the frames
remains the same and thus will correctly be overriden in child frames.


The interpretter could avoid using let and instead set the variables to '*unassigned* by directly
manipulating the frame where they are defined, but this would lead to less flexibility in our
program design.
