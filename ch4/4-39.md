I believe the order _does_ matter. Whenever we choose an amb, we need to check that
all conditions hold for it. If we can make fails happen faster, by checking conditions
more likely to fail early that will cause more aggressive back tracking...

^ turns out that's mostly wrong. This program can be sped up, but only because the
time that it takes to run the distinct? method is quadratic, and all other conditions 
are not
