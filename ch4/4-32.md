These lazier lists won't eval the head of a stream, or any of the
referenced values until they are used.

We can use this extra laziness when we want to avoid an expensive
computation for the head of stream unless it's absolutely necessary.

We can also use this fact to build lazy trees, since the branch nodes
don't have to be computed, even if they are the head of a new stream
