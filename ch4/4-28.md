You need to use actual-value in cases where the procedure is not a symbol,
but another procedure

Apply would not work if the first argument passed to it is not a reference to a valid
procedure (but instead of a procedure itself)

Also, in cases where a function is passed as a paramter, this parameter will be wrapped in a thunk
which can't be called further down the chain of evaluation anymore
